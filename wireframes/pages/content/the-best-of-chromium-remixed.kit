  <p>Crosswalk is a better runtime because, to begin with, we're starting with the best: Chromium and Blink.  Chromium is the open source version of the leading Chrome browser.  Blink is the heart of Chromium, derived (forked) from WebKit, the most popular HTML5 engine in the world.  We're using Blink, mixing in elements of Chromium and adding features specific to apps to create Crosswalk.  Rather than forking Blink, the Crosswalk project will actually help make Chromium itself more modular, and we think it's better for Cameo to begin with Blink from the bottom up rather than working backwards from Chromium. </p>

  <p>Crosswalk will have an extension interface to enable the easy addition of specialized APIs. In fact, we expect to offer Cordova APIs as extensions because they are widely used and offer a proof-of-concept for our extension interface.  We expect APIs to achieve quite high levels of performance through this lightweight interface.</p>
